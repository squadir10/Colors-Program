# Colors-Program
My very first C# project that has the user interact with a very polite bot that changes the color of the text based off user input

After learning the basics of C#, I felt ready to take what I've learnt from the basics and apply it to something much bigger. In this simple program, the user is greeted by a very polite robot that has the ability to change the color of the text based off of the user's favorite color.
